# Replicate Codespaces scripts

This is a convenience script that installs [Cog](https://github.com/replicate/cog) and nvidia-docker on GitHub's GPU Codespaces, so you can build run and push Cog models to Replicate.

To use it, run the following from the terminal in your Codespaces instance:

```
curl https://replicate.github.io/codespaces/scripts/install-cog.sh | bash
```
